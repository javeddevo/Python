    "\n",
    "### **10. What is AWS Lambda’s memory limit?**\n",
    "Lambda supports **128 MB to 10 GB** of memory allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Security and Permissions Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **11. How does AWS Lambda handle permissions?**\n",
    "AWS Lambda uses IAM roles and policies to grant permissions for accessing AWS services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **12. What is the role of the AWS Lambda execution role?**\n",
    "The execution role defines what AWS services the Lambda function can access.\n",

    "### **13. How do you secure an AWS Lambda function?**\n",
    "- Use **IAM roles** with the least privilege.\n",
    "- Enable **AWS Secrets Manager** for sensitive data.\n",

    "- Use **VPC** for private networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **14. What is AWS Lambda’s IAM policy structure?**\n",
    "A sample IAM policy for Lambda to access S3:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n",
    "  \"Action\": \"s3:GetObject\",\n",
    "  \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **15. How do you restrict Lambda access to specific IPs?**\n",
    "You can use **VPC and Security Groups** to restrict Lambda access to specific IP ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Event Sources and Integrations Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **16. How does AWS Lambda integrate with API Gateway?**\n",
    "API Gateway can trigger Lambda functions in response to HTTP requests, enabling serverless REST APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **17. How do you trigger a Lambda function from an S3 event?**\n",
    "You need to create an **S3 event notification** to trigger Lambda when an object is created/deleted in an S3 bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **18. What is an AWS Lambda Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)?**\n",
    "A DLQ is an **SQS queue** or **SNS topic** where failed Lambda events are sent for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **19. How does AWS Lambda interact with DynamoDB streams?**\n",
    "Lambda can process **DynamoDB Streams** to trigger a function when data changes in a table.\n",
